            <meta name="description" content="Regalia emulates royalty - it is not just an emotion, but a way of life that makes one feel a sense of belonging while also being in an exalted state of being. Regality is experienced by those who give their all, stand firm for what they believe in, and have faith in their purpose, like flowers that bloom through concrete. It does not require material possessions or money, but can be found in one's passion, vigour, and drive to achieve their dreams. When someone is driven by a strong sense of purpose and a burning desire to succeed, they radiate a regal aura that commands respect, admiration and reverence. In essence, true royalty is not about what one possesses, but rather about who they are and what they stand for. Utsav 2023 aims to uplift and nurture the light within us by celebrating our unique talents, strengths, and individuality. Fondly and aptly known as the Festival of Faith, Utsav is spotlighting the indomitable human spirit in its 2023 edition." />
